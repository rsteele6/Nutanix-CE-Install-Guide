# Nutanix-CE-Install-Guide
This is a demo technical writing project to demonstrate my skills. It's an installation guide intended to be used by field engineers employed by the fictional company RS Tech Services to install Nutanix Community Edition (CE) at customer sites.

If there is a real RS Tech Services out there, this guide is NOT affiliated with them in any way.
